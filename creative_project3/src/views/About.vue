        <h2>George D. Backyardner - Founder and CEO</h2>
        <br/>
        <p class="background">
        Growing up in rural North Dakota, our founder and CEO George D. Backyardner spent his childhood days
        playing in his backyard dreaming of exploring the world. Born in 1952, Backyardner was raised hard working.
        "If you don't work, you'll get nowehere!" his father would always say. After graduating from Cankdeska Cikana Community College in Fort Totton, ND
        George began a small business selling travel brochures (yes, just the brochures). This business began to flourish into travel books
        that would inform lucky customers on where they go to find different travel agencies.
        Over the years as technology and grown and the internet connected the world, George D. Backyardner pushed the limits
        on middle-man business and now owns the largest middle-man travel agency in the world. If you want to know where to find
        the best travel agencies, we know where to find them!
